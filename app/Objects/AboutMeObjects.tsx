My name is Felix Li and I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo and I'm looking for fall 2025 internships! \n\nWhen I'm not studying, you can find me at the gym, playing basketball, swimming, or learning about random stuff like Star Wars and Marvel! Recently I've been really into web development, which is the reason this website exists!",
